# C4.5-Decision-Tree-Algorithm-with-Pruning
Implementation of the C4.5 decision tree algorithm with pruning. This code builds a decision tree using the C4.5 algorithm and performs pruning to avoid overfitting. The decision tree is visualized using the graphviz library. 

The code also provides functions for making predictions, calculating accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, and counts of true positives and true negatives. The results are printed to the screen and written to a text file.
